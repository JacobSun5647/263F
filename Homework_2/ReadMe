Run the Main.py file, it will generate 6 plots
the 1st and 2nd plots is the shape of the beam
the 3rd plot is the time history of max y displacement
the 4th plot is the force sweep form 20N to 20000N vs. max y displacement using simplicit simulation
the 5th plot is the force sweep form 20N to 20000N vs. max y displacement using beam theory
the 6th plot the the combined plot of 4th and 5th plot
