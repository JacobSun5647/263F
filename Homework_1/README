Open main.py.
Enter your input information, including:
Nodal positions
Spring constants
The nodes connected by each spring
Free nodes (unconstrained nodes)

Run main.py.
The program will compute the motion of the spring network as a function of time and display the results.

Output
The simulation will show the shape of the spring network changing over time.
It will also plot the y-coordinates of all free nodes as a function of time.
